## Hi there 👋

#### My name is Maja Teichmann and I am currently studying to become an app developer at Syntax Institute.

![SyntaxInstitut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121936594/210576289-425c570e-6fe1-40a9-a68a-2e59fb13bdb2.png)

- 🌱 I am currently learning how to use IntelliJ IDEA, Kotlin and GitHub.

- 🔭 In the future I plan to work with my uncle on our first own app called "DA!".
  "DA!" documents seen shooting stars and enters them on an interactive sky map.
  You hold your smartphone up to the sky and trace the path of the shooting star ☄️.
